### Description
This is a **Django** project where users can create their own todo lists.
Project uses **sqlite** file to store db.
**Bootstrap** is used to style pages.

During this project I practiced and revisited:
- starting project.
- Setting a RESTful API with a number of endpoints which cover CRUD operations.
- Querying a database.
- Setting up parametric endpoints.

### Main endpoints are:
- '/' - home;
- '/create' - create todolist;
- '/view' - view todolists;
- '/register' - register user;
- '/login';

P.S. I plan to practice adding other features to this project. To be comtinued...
